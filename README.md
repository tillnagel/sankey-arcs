# Sankey Arcs 

Visualizing edge weights in path graphs.

Arc diagrams allow exploring relations and their strength between sequential nodes. Previous solutions suffer
from displaying all arcs at the center of a node, which can lead to visual obstruction. We present a new technique,
which extends the arc diagram technique by laying out the weighted edges of a node adjacent to each other. The
aim of our Sankey Arc technique is to improve clarity, to enable users perceiving and comparing weighted edges
in path graphs.

See our [paper](http://tillnagel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Nagel-SankeyArcs-EuroVis11.pdf) for details.


## Presentation 

Introduction into this technique with visual examples explaining the advantages to traditional arc diagrams, as well as its limitations.
